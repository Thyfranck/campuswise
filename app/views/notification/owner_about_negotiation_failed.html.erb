Dear <%= @user.name %>,
<br/>
<br/>
You wanted to <%= @exchange.package == "buy" ? "sell" : "lend" %> the book titled
'<%= @book.title %>' at the price <%= number_to_currency(@exchange.amount.to_f, :prescision => 2) %>. But the <%= @exchange.package == "buy" ? "buyer" : "borrower" %>
didn't agree with your requested price.
<br/>
<br/>
The <%= @exchange.package == "buy" ? "buyer" : "borrower" %> canceled the <%= @exchange.package == "buy" ? "purchase" : "borrow" %> request.
