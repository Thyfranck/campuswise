Dear <%= @user.name %>,
<br/>
<br/>
You wanted to <%= @exchange.package == "buy" ? "sell" : "lend" %> the book titled
'<%= @book.title %>' at the price $<%= @exchange.amount %>. But the borrower wanted to <%= @exchange.package == "buy" ? "purchase" : "borrow" %>
 at the price $<%= @exchange.counter_offer %>.
<br/>
<br/>
The <%= @exchange.package == "buy" ? "buyer" : "borrower" %> canceled the <%= @exchange.package == "buy" ? "purchase" : "borrow" %> request.
