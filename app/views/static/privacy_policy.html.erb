CampusWise receives your information through our various websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, and widgets (the "Services"). When using any of our Services, you hereby consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

        <h5>
          Information Collection and Use.
        </h5>
        <p>
          We collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve them over time. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong>
          When you create or reconfigure a CampusWise account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require registration.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Additional Information:</strong>
          You may provide us with profile information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, your website, or a picture. You may provide information to customize your account, such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market CampusWise services to you. You may use your account settings to unsubscribe from notifications from CampusWise. You may also unsubscribe by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on our website. We may use your contact information to help others find your CampusWise account, including through third-party services and client applications. Your account settings control whether others can find you by your email address or cell phone number. We may later suggest people to follow you on CampusWise’s website based on your imported address book contacts, which you can delete from CampusWise’s website at any time. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. This information helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from CampusWise within a few weeks of your deactivation of your account with CampusWise. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Location Information:</strong>
          You may choose to publish your location in your CampusWise profile or enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services to improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Links:</strong>
          CampusWise may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cookies:</strong>
          Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. CampusWise may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Log Data:</strong>
          Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your CampusWise account to authenticate to a third-party website or application, or visit a third-party website that includes a Twitter button or widget. CampusWise uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, 18 months from the date you deactivate your account with CampusWise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong>
          CampusWise uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address.
        </p>

        <h5>Information Sharing and Disclosure.</h5>
        <p>
          We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described herein.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Your Consent:</strong>
          We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your CampusWise account.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Service Providers:</strong>
          We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States and abroad. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Law and Harm:</strong>
          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect CampusWise's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to access or disclose your information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Business Transfers:</strong>
          In the event that CampusWise is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</strong>
          We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information, the people you interact with by using our Services, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one (1) did).
        </p>

        <h5>Modifying Your Personal Information</h5>
        <p>
          If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.
          <br/>
          You can also permanently delete your CampusWise account. If you follow the instructions here, your account will be deactivated and then deleted. When your account is deactivated, it is not viewable on CampusWise.com. For up to 30 days after deactivation, it is still possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. After 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which can take up to 18 months.
        </p>

        <h5>Our Policy Towards Children</h5>
        <p>
          Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at
          <%= mail_to "info@campuswise.com" %>
          . We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.
        </p>
